- M2: Calendar integration and meeting workflows.
- M3: Multi-user and team sharing.

## Sprint Plan (2-week sprints)

- Sprint 2: AI abstraction, chat interface, draft generation.
- Sprint 3: Notes/tasks and improved categorization.
- Sprint 4: Calendar integration and meeting summaries.

## Integration Order
- Storage -> Email ingest -> Categories -> AI abstraction -> Chat -> Notes/Tasks -> Calendar -> Multi-user.
