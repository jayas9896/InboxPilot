# CL-0025

## Summary
- Stored placeholder OAuth tokens on callback for MVP flow completion.

## Rationale
- Completes the OAuth path while keeping full token exchange as future work.

## Files Created
- docs/change-log-detailed/CL-0025.md

## Files Updated
- src/inboxpilot/api.py
- README.md
- docs/architecture.md
- docs/domain-model.md
- docs/commit-log.md

## Decisions
- Store the auth code as a placeholder access token; replace with real exchange later.

## Tests
- Not applicable; existing OAuth callback test covers the path.
