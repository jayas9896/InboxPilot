# CL-0037

## Summary
- Added user and API key services with hashed key storage.
- Introduced per-request user scoping in the API using API keys.
- Added admin endpoints for user creation and key issuance.
- Updated CLI, docs, and tests for multi-user scaffolding.

## Rationale
Multi-user support requires per-user authentication tokens and request scoping. This change lays the foundation for multi-user deployments without breaking single-user local usage.

## Files Changed
- `src/inboxpilot/storage/sqlite_store.py`
- `src/inboxpilot/services.py`
- `src/inboxpilot/app.py`
- `src/inboxpilot/api.py`
- `src/inboxpilot/cli.py`
- `tests/test_api.py`
- `tests/test_api_keys.py`
- `tests/test_config.py`
- `README.md`
- `docs/mvp-status.md`
- `docs/domain-model.md`
- `docs/commit-log.md`

## Decisions
- Stored API keys as salted hashes to avoid raw token persistence.
- Allowed admin actions without `INBOXPILOT_API_KEY` for local-first setups.

## Tests
- Added API key service tests and API flow coverage.
