# CL-0010

## Summary
- Added a local web dashboard served by the FastAPI layer.

## Rationale
- Provides a user-friendly, chat-style UI without requiring a separate frontend stack.

## Files Created
- web/index.html
- docs/change-log-detailed/CL-0010.md

## Files Updated
- src/inboxpilot/api.py
- README.md
- docs/architecture.md
- docs/commit-log.md

## Decisions
- Serve static HTML directly from the API to keep the MVP lightweight.

## Tests
- Not applicable for static UI changes.
