# CL-0022

## Summary
- Added OAuth callback handling to record authorized connections.

## Rationale
- Completes the OAuth flow path while keeping secrets out of storage.

## Files Created

- tests/test_api.py

## Decisions
- Store only connection status from OAuth callbacks; token exchange is future work.

## Tests
