# CL-0034

## Summary
- Added OAuth token refresh support and access token retrieval in TokenService.
- Added refresh payload handling in OAuth helpers and tests.
- Updated docs to reflect token refresh support.

## Rationale
Refresh tokens are required for long-lived provider integrations. This adds automatic refresh for expired access tokens without user re-auth.

## Files Changed
- `src/inboxpilot/oauth.py`
- `src/inboxpilot/services.py`
- `src/inboxpilot/app.py`
- `tests/test_tokens.py`
- `tests/test_oauth.py`
- `docs/mvp-status.md`
- `README.md`
- `docs/commit-log.md`

## Decisions
- Refreshed tokens when expiry is within 60 seconds to avoid edge failures.
- Left provider ingestion for a later milestone while ensuring refresh is ready.

## Tests
- Added refresh coverage for TokenService and OAuth payloads.
