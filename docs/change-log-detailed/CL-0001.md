# CL-0001

## Summary
- Initialized the repository and added baseline documentation scaffolding.

## Rationale
- Establishes the required change-log discipline and project structure from the outset.

## Files Created
- README.md
- docs/commit-log.md
- docs/change-log-detailed/CL-0001.md
- docs/coding-standards.md

## Decisions

## Tests
- Not applicable for scaffolding.
