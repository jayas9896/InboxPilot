# CL-0028

## Summary
- Extended CLI to support notes and tasks for both messages and meetings.

## Rationale
- Aligns task/note workflows with meeting entities for full coverage.

## Files Created
- docs/change-log-detailed/CL-0028.md

## Files Updated
- src/inboxpilot/cli.py
- README.md
- docs/commit-log.md

## Decisions
- Keep API unchanged; CLI now exposes parent_type/parent_id inputs.

## Tests
- Not applicable for CLI-only changes.
