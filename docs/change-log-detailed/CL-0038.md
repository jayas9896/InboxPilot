# CL-0038

## Summary
- Added API key revocation support in storage and services.
- Exposed key deletion in API and CLI, with updated docs and tests.

## Rationale
Key revocation is required for safe multi-user operations and response to compromised tokens.

## Files Changed
- `src/inboxpilot/storage/sqlite_store.py`
- `src/inboxpilot/services.py`
- `src/inboxpilot/api.py`
- `src/inboxpilot/cli.py`
- `tests/test_api.py`
- `tests/test_api_keys.py`
- `README.md`
- `docs/mvp-status.md`
- `docs/commit-log.md`

## Decisions
- Used hard deletes for revoked keys to keep the MVP simple.
- Admin-only revocation via API to reduce accidental deletions.

## Tests
- Added API key revocation tests in service and API layers.
